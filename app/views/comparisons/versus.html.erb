    That's a subjective opinion, and it probably depends on what you're doing.  
    But here are some hard data.  Compare number of StackOverflow posts per month referring to each technology.
    You probably don't want to go with a technology with usage in decline, and generally you'll
    be better off with one that's got more usage and growing quickly.
