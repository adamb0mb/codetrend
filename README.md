# CodeTrend

This is a public open service for comparing trends in software technologies.

It is available for public use at http://www.codetrend.org/

Currently it only uses StackExchange data, but in the future I envision it pulling additional
signals like google trends, ohloh, github, tiobe.

Moreover, since these comparisons are so subjective, I'd like to see this site
be a place where people can express their opinions comparing competing technologies.
If we provide a medium for these opinions that can aggregate them intelligently,
then we will have a truly useful and self-supporting resource.
